= Cascading Basics

== Terminology

The Cascading processing model is based on a metaphor of pipes (data streams)
and filters (data operations). Thus the Cascading API allows the developer to
assemble pipe assemblies that split, merge, group, or join streams of data while
applying operations to each data record or groups of records.

In Cascading, we call a data record a _tuple_, a simple chain of pipes without
forks or merges a _branch_, an interconnected set of pipe branches a _pipe
assembly_, and a series of tuples passing through a pipe branch or assembly a
_tuple stream_.

Pipe assemblies are specified independently of the data source they are to
process. So before a pipe assembly can be executed, it must be bound to _taps_,
i.e., data sources and sinks. The result of binding one or more pipe assemblies
to taps is a _flow_, which is executed on a computer or cluster.

Multiple flows can be grouped together and executed as a single unit of work or
process. In this context, if one flow depends on the output of another, it is
not executed until all of its data dependencies are satisfied. Such a collection
of flows is called a _cascade_.

== Pipe Assemblies

Pipe assemblies define what work should be done against tuple streams, which are
read from tap _sources_ and written to tap _sinks_. The work performed on the
data stream may include actions such as filtering, transforming, organizing, and
calculating.

Pipe assemblies may use multiple sources and multiple sinks, and may define
splits, merges, and joins to manipulate the tuple streams.

=== Pipe Assembly Workflow

Pipe assemblies are created by chaining [classname]+cascading.pipe.Pipe+ classes
and subclasses together. Chaining is accomplished by passing the previous
[classname]+Pipe+ instances to the constructor of the next [classname]+Pipe+
instance.

The following example demonstrates this type of chaining. The specific
operations performed are not important in the example; the point is to show the
general flow of the data streams.

It creates two pipes - a "left-hand side" (lhs) and a "right-hand side" (rhs) -
and performs some processing on them both, using the [classname]+Each+ pipe.
Then it joins the two pipes into one, using the [classname]+CoGroup+ pipe, and
performs several operations on the joined pipe using [classname]+Every+ and
[classname]+GroupBy+. The diagram after the example gives a visual
representation of the workflow.

=== Common Stream Patterns

As data moves through the pipe, streams may be separated or combined for various
purposes. Here are the three basic patterns:

Split::
A split takes a single stream and sends it down multiple paths - that
is, it feeds a single [classname]+Pipe+ instance into two or more subsequent
separate [classname]+Pipe+ instances with unique branch names.

Merge::
A merge combines two or more streams that have identical fields into a single
stream. This is done by passing two or more [classname]+Pipe+ instances to a
[classname]+Merge+ or [classname]+GroupBy+ pipe. This is also called a union.

Join::
A join combines data from two or more streams that have different fields, based
on common field values (analogous to a SQL join.) This is done by passing two or
more [classname]+Pipe+ instances to a [classname]+HashJoin+ or
[classname]+CoGroup+ pipe. The code sequence and diagram above give an example.

=== Data Processing

In addition to directing the tuple streams - using splits, merges, and joins -
pipe assemblies can examine, filter, organize, and transform the tuple data as
the streams move through the pipe assemblies. To facilitate this, the values in
the tuple are typically (optionally) given field names, just as database columns
are given names, so that they may be referenced or selected.

The following terminology is used:

Operation::

Operations ([classname]+cascading.operation.Operation+) accept an input argument
Tuple, and output zero or more result tuples. There are a few sub-types of
operations defined below. Cascading has a number of generic Operations that can
be used, or developers can create their own custom Operations.

Tuple::

In Cascading, data is processed as a stream of Tuples
([classname]+cascading.tuple.Tuple+), which are composed of fields, much like a
database record or row. A Tuple is effectively an array of (field) values, where
each value can be any [classname]+java.lang.Object+ Java type (or [code]+byte[]+
array). For information on supporting non-primitive types, see
<<ch20-extending-cascading.adoc#custom-types, Custom Types>>.

Fields::

Fields ([classname]+cascading.tuple.Fields+) are used either to declare the
field names for fields in a Tuple, or reference field values in a Tuple. They
can either be strings (such as "firstname" or "birthdate"), integers (for the
field position, starting at [code]+0+ for the first position, or starting at
[code]+-1+ for the last position), or one of the predefined __Fields sets__
(such as [code]+Fields.ALL+, which selects all values in the Tuple, like an
asterisk in SQL). For more on Fields sets, see
<<ch05-field-sets.adoc#_field_sets, Field Sets>>).

== Pipes

The code for the sample pipe assembly above, <<chaining-pipes>>, consists almost
entirely of a series of [classname]+Pipe+ constructors. This section describes
the various [classname]+Pipe+ classes in detail.

The base class [classname]+cascading.pipe.Pipe+ and its subclasses are shown in
the diagram below.

image:images/pipes.svg[align="center"]

=== Types of Pipes

[classname]+Each+::

These pipes perform operations based on the data contents of tuples - analyze,
transform, or filter. The [classname]+Each+ pipe operates on individual tuples
in the stream, applying functions or filters such as conditionally replacing
certain field values, removing tuples that have values outside a target range,
etc.

+

You can also use [classname]+Each+ to split or branch a stream, simply by
routing the output of an [classname]+Each+ into a different pipe or sink. + Note
that with [classname]+Each+, as with other types of pipe, you can specify a list
of fields to output, thereby removing unwanted fields from a stream.

[classname]+Merge+::

Just as [classname]+Each+ can be used to split one stream into two,
[classname]+Merge+ can be used to combine two or more streams into one, as long
as they have the same fields.

+

A [classname]+Merge+ accepts two or more streams that have identical fields, and
emits a single stream of tuples (in arbitrary order) that contains all the
tuples from all the specified input streams. Thus a Merge is just a mingling of
all the tuples from the input streams, as if shuffling multiple card decks into
one.

+

Use [classname]+Merge+ when no grouping is required (i.e., no aggregator or
buffer operations will be performed). Subsequently [classname]+Merge+ is much
faster than [classname]+GroupBy+ (see below) for merging.

+

To combine streams that have different fields, based on one or more common
values, use [classname]+CoGroup+ or [classname]+HashJoin+.

[classname]+GroupBy+::

[classname]+GroupBy+ groups the tuples of a stream based on common values in a
specified field.

+

If passed multiple streams as inputs, it performs a merge before the grouping.
As with [classname]+Merge+, a [classname]+GroupBy+ requires that multiple input
streams share the same field structure.

+

The purpose of grouping is typically to prepare a stream for processing by the
[classname]+Every+ pipe, which performs aggregator and buffer operations on the
groups, such as counting, totaling, or averaging values within that group.

+

It should be clear that "grouping" here essentially means sorting all the tuples
into groups based on the value of a particular field. However, within a given
group, the tuples are in arbitrary order unless you specify a secondary sort
key. For most purposes, a secondary sort is not required and only increases the
execution time.

[classname]+Every+::

The [classname]+Every+ pipe operates on a tuple stream that has been grouped (by
[classname]+GroupBy+ or [classname]++CoGroup++) on the values of a particular
field, such as "timestamp" or "zipcode". It's used to apply aggregator or buffer
operations such as counting, totaling, or averaging field values within each
group. Thus the [classname]+Every+ class is only for use on the output of
[classname]+GroupBy+ or [classname]+CoGroup+, and cannot be used with the output
of [classname]+Each+, [classname]+Merge+, or [classname]+HashJoin+.

+

An [classname]+Every+ instance may follow another [classname]+Every+ instance,
so [classname]+Aggregator+ operations can be chained. This is not true for
[classname]+Buffer+ operations.


[classname]+CoGroup+::

[classname]+CoGroup+ performs a join on two or more streams, similar to a SQL
join, and groups the single resulting output stream on the values of specified
fields. As with SQL, the join can be inner, outer, left, or right. Self-joins are
permitted, as well as mixed joins (for three or more streams) and custom joins.
Null fields in the input streams become corresponding null fields in the output
stream.

+

The resulting output stream contains fields from all the input streams. If the
streams contain any field names in common, they must be renamed to avoid
duplicate field names in the resulting tuples.

[classname]+HashJoin+::

[classname]+HashJoin+ performs a join on two or more streams, similar to a SQL
join, and emits a single stream in arbitrary order. As with SQL, the join can be
inner, outer, left, or right. Self-joins are permitted, as well as mixed joins
(for three or more streams) and custom joins. Null fields in the input streams
become corresponding null fields in the output stream.

+

For applications that do not require grouping, [classname]+HashJoin+ provides
faster execution than [classname]+CoGroup+, but only within certain prescribed
cases. It is optimized for joining one or more small streams to no more than one
large stream. Developers should thoroughly understand the limitations of this
class, as described below, before attempting to use it.

The following table summarizes the different types of pipes.

.Comparison of pipe types

|====
| *_Pipe type_* | *_Purpose_* | *_Input_* | *_Output_*
| [classname]+Pipe+ | instantiate a pipe; create or name a branch | name | a (named) pipe
| [classname]+SubAssembly+ | create nested subassemblies | |
| [classname]+Each+ | apply a filter or function, or branch a stream | tuple stream (grouped or not) | a tuple stream, optionally filtered or transformed
| [classname]+Merge+ | merge two or more streams with identical fields | two or more tuple streams | a tuple stream, unsorted
| [classname]+GroupBy+ | sort/group on field values; optionally merge two or more streams with identical fields | one or more tuple streams with identical fields | a single tuple stream, grouped on key field(s) with optional secondary sort
| [classname]+Every+ | apply aggregator or buffer operation | grouped tuple stream | a tuple stream plus new fields with operation results
| [classname]+CoGroup+ | join 1 or more streams on matching field values | one or more tuple streams | a single tuple stream, joined on key field(s)
| [classname]+HashJoin+ | join 1 or more streams on matching field values | one or more tuple streams | a tuple stream in arbitrary order
|====

[[platforms]]
== Platforms

Cascading supports pluggable planners that allow it to execute on differing
platforms. Planners are invoked by an associated [classname]+FlowConnector+
subclass. Currently, only four planners are provided, as described below:

LocalFlowConnector::

The [classname]+cascading.flow.local.LocalFlowConnector+ provides a "local" mode
planner for running Cascading completely in memory on the current computer. This
allows for fast execution of Flows against local files or any other compatible
custom [classname]+Tap+ and [classname]+Scheme+ classes.

+

The local mode planner and platform were not designed to scale beyond available
memory, CPU, or disk on the current machine. Thus any memory-intensive processes
that use [classname]+GroupBy+, [classname]+CoGroup+, or [classname]+HashJoin+
are likely to fail against moderately large files.

+

Local mode is useful for development, testing, and interactive data exploration
against sample sets.

HadoopFlowConnector::

The [classname]+cascading.flow.hadoop.HadoopFlowConnector+ provides a planner
for running Cascading on an Apache Hadoop 1.x cluster. This allows Cascading to
execute against extremely large data sets over a cluster of computing nodes.

+

Note Hadoop 1.x only provides the MapReduce model for distributed computation.


Hadoop2MR1FlowConnector::

The [classname]+cascading.flow.hadoop2.Hadoop2MR1FlowConnector+ provides a
planner for running Cascading on an Apache Hadoop 2.x cluster. This class is
roughly equivalent to the above [classname]+HadoopFlowConnector+ except it uses
Hadoop 2 specific properties and is compiled against Hadoop 2 API binaries.

+

The underlying planner and execution is against the default MapReduce Hadoop API.

Hadoop2TezFlowConnector::

The [classname]+cascading.flow.tez.planner.Hadoop2TezFlowConnector+ provides a
planner for running Cascading on an Apache Hadoop 2.x cluster with [Apache
Tez](http://tez.apache.org) as an installed YARN application. It is beyond the
scope of this document to provide Tez installation instructions.


Cascading's support for pluggable planners allows a pipe assembly to be executed
on an arbitrary platform, using platform-specific Tap and Scheme classes that
hide the platform-related I/O details from the developer. For example, Hadoop
uses [classname]+org.apache.hadoop.mapred.InputFormat+ to read data, but local
mode is happy with a [classname]+java.io.FileInputStream+. This detail is hidden
from developers unless they are creating custom Tap and Scheme classes.

[[source-sink]]
== Sourcing and Sinking Data

All input data comes in from, and all output data goes out to, some instance of
[classname]+cascading.tap.Tap+ and [classname]+cascading.scheme.Scheme+ pair. A
Tap knows where data is located and how to access it - such as a file on the
local file system, on a Hadoop distributed file system, or on Amazon S3, and a
Scheme knows what the data is and how to read or write it - such as the
column/field names and if the file is text or binary.

A tap can be read from, which makes it a _source_, or written to, which makes it
a _sink_. Or, more commonly, taps act as both sinks and sources when shared
between flows (a tap may not be used as both a source and sink in the same
flow).

The platform on which your application is running determines which specific Tap and Scheme
classes you can use. Details are provided in subsequent chapters.

=== Common Schemes

Some Schemes are functionally common across platforms but remain platform
specific in implementation. To prevent naming collisions, each class will have a
platform specific package name.

Cascading provides two common Scheme types:

TextLine::

[classname]+TextLine+ reads and writes raw text files and returns tuples which,
by default, contain two fields specific to the platform used. The first field is
either the byte offset or line number, and the second field is the actual line
of text. When written to, all Tuple values are converted to Strings delimited
with the TAB character (\t). A TextLine scheme is provided for both the local
and Hadoop modes.

+

By default TextLine uses the UTF-8 character set. This can be overridden on the
appropriate TextLine constructor.

TextDelimited::

[classname]+TextDelimited+ reads and writes character-delimited files in
standard formats such as CSV (comma-separated variables), TSV (tab-separated
variables), and so on. When written to, all Tuple values are converted to
Strings and joined with the specified character delimiter. This Scheme can
optionally handle quoted values with custom quote characters. Further,
TextDelimited can coerce each value to a primitive type when reading a text
file. A TextDelimited scheme is provided for both the local and Hadoop modes.

+

By default TextDelimited uses the UTF-8 character set. This can be overridden on
appropriate the TextDelimited constructor.

==== Platform-specific implementation details

Depending on which platform you use (Cascading local, Hadoop MapReduce, or
Apache Tez), the classes you use to specify schemes will vary. Platform-specific
details for each standard scheme are shown below.

.Platform-specific tap scheme classes
|====
| *Description* | *Cascading local platform* | *Hadoop platform*
| *Package Name* | [classname]+cascading.scheme.local+ | [classname]+cascading.scheme.hadoop+
| Read lines of text | [classname]+TextLine+ | [classname]+TextLine+
| Read delimited text (CSV, TSV, etc) | [classname]+TextDelimited+ | [classname]+TextDelimited+
|====

=== Common Taps

The following sample code creates a new local FileSystem Tap that can read and
write raw text files. Since only one field name is provided, the "num" field
is discarded, resulting in an input tuple stream with only "line" values.

.Creating a new tap
====
include::simple-tap.adoc[]
====

Some Taps are functionally common across platforms but remain platform
specific in implementation. To prevent naming collisions, each class will have a
platform specific package name.

Cascading provides one common Tap type:

PartitionTap::

The [classname]+cascading.tap.hadoop.PartitionTap+ and
[classname]+cascading.tap.local.PartitionTap+ are used to sink tuples into
directory paths based on the values in the Tuple. More can be read below in
<<ch16-advanced.adoc#partition-tap, PartitionTap>>.

Utility taps can be used to combine other Tap instances into a single Tap, or
are useful to sub-class from when creating other purpose built Tap types. These
taps are platform independent.

There are six utility taps:

MultiSourceTap::

The [classname]+cascading.tap.MultiSourceTap+ is used to tie multiple tap
instances into a single tap for use as an input source. The only restriction is
that all the tap instances passed to a new MultiSourceTap share the same Scheme
classes (not necessarily the same Scheme instance).

MultiSinkTap::

The [classname]+cascading.tap.MultiSinkTap+ is used to tie multiple tap
instances into a single tap for use as output sinks. At runtime, for every Tuple
output by the pipe assembly, each child tap to the MultiSinkTap will sink the
Tuple.

DecoratorTap::

The [classname]+cascading.tap.DecoratorTap+ is a utility helper for wrapping an
existing Tap with new functionality, via a sub-class, and/or adding 'meta-data' to
a Tap instance via the generic [classname]+MetaInfo+ instance field. Further, on
the Hadoop platform, planner created intermediate and [classname]+Checkpoint+
Taps can be wrapped by a [classname]+DecoratorTap+ implementation by the
Cascading Planner. See [classname]+cascading.flow.FlowConnectorProps+ for
details.

==== Platform-specific implementation details

Depending on which platform you use (Cascading local or Hadoop), the classes you
use to specify file systems will vary. Platform-specific details for each
standard tap type are shown below.

| *Description* | *Either platform* | *Cascading local platform* | *Hadoop platform*
| *Package Name* | [classname]+cascading.tap+ | [classname]+cascading.tap.local+ | [classname]+cascading.tap.hadoop+
| Multiple Taps as single source | [classname]+MultiSourceTap+ | |
| Multiple Taps as single sink | [classname]+MultiSinkTap+ | |
| Bin/Partition data into multiple files | | [classname]+PartitionTap+ | [classname]+PartitionTap+

== Sink Modes

.Overwriting An Existing Resource
====
include::simple-replace-tap.adoc[]
====

All applications created with Cascading read data from one or more sources,
process it, then write data to one or more sinks. This is done via the various
[classname]+Tap+ classes, where each class abstracts different types of back-end
systems that store data as files, tables, blobs, and so on. But in order to sink
data, some systems require that the resource (e.g., a file) not exist before
processing thus must be removed (deleted) before the processing can begin. Other
systems may allow for appending or updating of a resource (typical with database
tables).

When creating a new [classname]+Tap+ instance, a
[classname]+cascading.tap.SinkMode+ may be provided so that the Tap will know
how to handle any existing resources. Note that not all Taps support all
[classname]+SinkMode+ values - for example, Hadoop does not support appends
(updates) from a MapReduce job.

The available SinkModes are:

[classname]+SinkMode.KEEP+::

This is the default behavior. If the resource exists, attempting to write over
it will fail.

[classname]+SinkMode.REPLACE+::

This notifies Cascading it may delete the file immediately after the Flow is
started.

[classname]+SinkMode.UPDATE+::

Allows for new tap types that can update or append - for example, to update or
add records in a database. Each tap may implement this functionality in its own
way. Cascading recognizes this update mode, and if a resource exists, will not
fail or attempt to delete it.

Note that Cascading itself only uses these labels internally to know when to
automatically call [methodname]+deleteResource()+ on the [classname]+Tap+ or to
leave the Tap alone. It is up the the [classname]+Tap+ implementation to
actually perform a write or update when processing starts. Thus, when
[methodname]+start()+ or [methodname]+complete()+ is called on a
[classname]+Flow+, any sink [classname]+Tap+ labeled
[classname]+SinkMode.REPLACE+ will have its [methodname]+deleteResource()+
method called.

Conversely, if a [classname]+Flow+ is in a [classname]+Cascade+ and the
[classname]+Tap+ is set to [classname]+SinkMode.KEEP+ or
[classname]+SinkMode.REPLACE+, [methodname]+deleteResource()+ will be called if
and only if the sink is stale (i.e., older than the source). This allows a
[classname]+Cascade+ to behave like a complier build file, only running Flows
that should be run. For more information, see <<ch06-flows.adoc#skipping-flows,
Skipping Flows>>.

[[flows]]
== Flows

When pipe assemblies are bound to source and sink taps, a [classname]+Flow+ is
created. Flows are executable in the sense that, once they are created, they can
be started and will execute on the specified platform. If the Hadoop platform is
specified, the Flow will execute on a Hadoop cluster.

A Flow is essentially a data processing pipeline that reads data
from sources, processes the data as defined by the pipe assembly, and
writes data to the sinks. Input source data does not need to exist at
the time the Flow is created, but it must exist by the time the Flow is
executed.

The most common pattern is to create a Flow from an existing pipe assembly. But
there are cases where a MapReduce job (if running on Hadoop) has already been
created, and it makes sense to encapsulate it in a Flow class so that it may
participate in a [classname]+Cascade+ and be scheduled with other
[classname]+Flow+ instances.

Alternatively, <<ch06-flows.adoc#custom-flows,custom Flows>> can be created so
that third-party applications can participate in a [classname]+Cascade+, and
complex algorithms that result in iterative Flow executions can be encapsulated
as a single Flow.
