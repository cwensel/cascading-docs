== Configuring

=== Introduction

Cascading provides a number of ways to pass properties down for use by built-in
or custom operations and integrations, to Cascading internals, or to the
underlying platform.

Additionally the scope of the configuration properties can be application-wide,
limited to a <<ch06-flows.adoc#process-levels,specific process level>> (a Flow,
a FlowStep, or a FlowNode), or specific to a given Pipe or Tap instance.

=== Creating Properties

Cascading is very configurable. You can configure aspects of Cascading by
creating a property set. Each property consists of a key-value pair.
The key is a String value, such as [code]+cascading.app.appjar.path+. The value
is the String path to the "app JAR."

Property sets can be managed directly in a [classname]+java.util.Properties+
instance. This class has methods that allow [code]+*.property+ files to be
loaded from disk or other locations.

NOTE: [classname]+Properties+ is a subclass of [classname]+Map<Object,Object>+.
Any Map type can be used, so long as key-value pairs are stored as
type [classname]+java.util.String+.

NOTE: [classname]+Properties+ can be nested via the constructor creating a
hierarchy of default key values. But calling [code]+getKeySet()+ and other
[classname]+Map+-specific API calls does not return the nested key values. See
[methodname]+Properties.getPropertyNames()+.

==== Props

All frequently used Cascading properties are encapsulated in subsystem-specific
[classname]+Props+ subclasses. All [classname]+Props+ classes are fluent-style
interfaces for creating property sets. For example, the [classname]+AppProps+
class can be used for setting application-level configuration settings.

The [classname]+Props+ interface allows for both setting available values as
well as populating either a [classname]+Properties+ or [classname]+ConfigDef+
instance for use by Cascading.

There are various "Props-based" classes that expose fluent API calls. The
following table lists the most commonly used classes for creating property sets
with fluent-style interfaces.

|====

| [classname]+cascading.property.AppProps+ | Allows for setting
application-specific properties. Some properties are required by the underlying
platform, like application JAR. Others are simple metadata used by compatible
management tools, like tags.

| [classname]+cascading.flow.FlowConnectorProps+ | Allows for setting a
[classname]+DebugLevel+ or [classname]+AssertionLevel+ for a given FlowConnector
to target. Also allows for setting intermediate [classname]+DecoratorTap+
subclasses to be used, if any.

| [classname]+cascading.flow.FlowProps+ | Allows for setting any Flow-specific
properties like the maximum concurrent steps to be scheduled, or changing the
default Tuple Comparator class.

| [classname]+cascading.flow.FlowRuntimeProps+ | Allows for setting specific
runtime properties, like the level of parallelization to use.

| [classname]+cascading.cascade.CascadeProps+ | Allows for setting any
Cascade-specific properties like the maximum concurrent Flows to be scheduled.

| [classname]+cascading.tap.TrapProps+ | Allows for fine-grained configuration
of what diagnostic data traps should capture on failures.

| [classname]+cascading.tuple.collect.SpillableProps+ | Allows for fine-grained
control over how to manage spilling of data during certain operators that
accumulate data. Specifically thresholds and what compression codecs to use.

| [classname]+cascading.pipe.assembly.AggregateByProps+ | Allows for
fine-grained control over the underlying caches used.

=== Passing Properties

Properties can be applied to the following scopes:

* Application: through a default, shared [classname]+Properties+ instance

* [classname]+Flow+: through a Flow-specific [classname]+Properties+ instance
passed to the proper [classname]+FlowConnector+

* [classname]+FlowStep+: through either [methodname]+Pipe.getStepConfigDef()+
or [methodname]+Tap.getStepConfigDef()+

* [classname]+FlowNode+: through either [methodname]+Pipe.getNodeConfigDef()+
or [methodname]+Tap.getNodeConfigDef()+

* [classname]+Pipe+: through [methodname]+Pipe.getConfigDef()+

* [classname]+Tap+: through [methodname]+Tap.getConfigDef()+

In the cases of [classname]+FlowStep+ and [classname]+FlowNode+, the
[classname]+Pipe+ and [classname]+Tap+ instances that are coded to run on those
levels are inspected for property settings. The property settings are merged
and, if possible, applied to the underlying configuration for that level.

NOTE: [classname]+FlowNode+-level properties cannot be applied to the
MapReduce platform.

==== Planner Properties

Properties passed to a [classname]+FlowConnector+ are checked by the Cascading
query planner. In addition, these properties are pushed directly to the
underlying platform as defaults. Any such properties can be overridden by a
given scoped [classname]+ConfigDef+ instance.

==== ConfigDef

The ConfigDef class supports the creation of a configuration properties
template. The template can then be applied to an existing properties
configuration set.

There are three property mode: [classname]+Mode.DEFAULT+,
[classname]+Mode.REPLACE+, and [classname]+Mode.UPDATE+.

 * A [classname]+DEFAULT+ property is only applied if there is no existing value
 in the property set.

 * A [classname]+REPLACE+ property is always applied overriding any previous
 values.

 * An [classname]+UPDATE+ property is always applied to an existing property,
 usually when the property key represents a list of values.

The following examples show using the [classname]+ConfigDef+ at different
scopes.
