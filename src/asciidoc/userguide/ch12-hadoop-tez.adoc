== Apache Tez Platform

The following documentation covers details about using Cascading on the
Apache Tez platform that are not covered in the
<<ch10-hadoop-common.adoc#apache-hadoop,Apache Hadoop>> documentation of this
guide.

The most up-to-date information about running Cascading on Apache Tez and
supported Tez releases can be found in a GitHub repo README at:

Released Source::
  https://github.com/cascading/cascading/tree/3.1/cascading-hadoop2-tez

Work-in-Progress Source::
  https://github.com/cwensel/cascading/tree/wip-3.1/cascading-hadoop2-tez

Apache Tez is a noticeable improvement over MapReduce. Tez's merits include:

* No more "identity mappers" -- mappers that simply forward data to a reducer
* Support for multiple outputs
* No prefixing data with join ordinality
* Suppression of sorting when not required
* Removal of HDFS as an intermediate store between jobs

=== Configuring Applications

During runtime, Hadoop must be told which application JAR file should be pushed
to the cluster.

In order to remain platform-independent, the [classname]+AppProps+ class should
be used as described in the <<ch10-hadoop-common.adoc#configuring,configuring
applications for Hadoop>> documentation.

=== Building

Cascading ships with several JARs and dependencies in the download archive.

Alternatively, Cascading is available over Maven and Ivy through the Conjars
repository, along with a number of other Cascading-related projects. See
http://conjars.org for more information.

The Cascading Hadoop artifacts include the following:

[code]+cascading-core-3.x.y.jar+::

This JAR contains the Cascading Core class files. It should be packaged with
[code]+lib/*.jar+ when using Hadoop.

[code]+cascading-hadoop2-tez-3.x.y.jar+::

This JAR contains the Cascading Hadoop 2 and Apache Tez specific dependencies.
It should be packaged with [code]+lib/*.jar+ when using Hadoop.

[code]+cascading-hadoop2-tez-stats-3.x.y.jar+::

This JAR is a dependency of [code]+cascading-hadoop2-tez-3.x.y.jar+ and will
be automatically included in a Maven or Gradle build.

Cascading works with either of the Hadoop processing modes -- the default local
stand-alone mode and the distributed cluster mode. As specified in the Hadoop
documentation, running in cluster mode requires the creation of a Hadoop job JAR
that includes the Cascading JARs, plus any needed third-party JARs, in its
[code]+lib+ directory. This is true regardless of whether they are Cascading
Hadoop-mode applications or raw Apache Tez applications.
