= Built-In Operations



== Identity Function

The [classname]+cascading.operation.Identity+ function
is used to "shape" a tuple stream. Here are some common patterns that
illustrate how Cascading "field algebra" works. (Note that, in actual
practice, some of these example tasks might be better performed with
helper subassemblies such as
[classname]+cascading.pipe.assembly.Rename+,
[classname]+cascading.pipe.assembly.Retain+, and
[classname]+cascading.pipe.assembly.Discard+.)

Discard unused fields::
include::identity-discard-fields-long.adoc[]
Here Identity passes its arguments out as results, thanks
to the [code]+Fields.ARGS+ field declaration.




+
In practice the field declaration can be left out, as
[code]+Field.ARGS+ is the default declaration for the
Identity function. And [code]+Fields.RESULTs+ can be left
off, as it is the default for the [classname]+Every+
pipe. Thus, simpler code yields the same result:

include::identity-discard-fields.adoc[]


Rename all fields::
include::identity-rename-fields-explicit.adoc[]
Here Identity renames the incoming arguments. Since
Fields.RESULTS is implied, the incoming Tuple is replaced by the
selected arguments and given new field names as declared on
Identity.




+
In the example above, if there were more fields than "ip"
and "method", it would work fine - all the extra fields would be
discarded. But if the same were true for the next example, the
planner would fail.

include::identity-rename-fields-long.adoc[]



+
Since [code]+Fields.ALL+ is the default argument
selector for the [classname]+Each+ pipe, it can be
left out as shown below. Again, the above and below examples
will fail unless there are exactly two fields in the tuples of
the incoming stream.

include::identity-rename-fields.adoc[]


Rename a single field::
include::identity-rename-some.adoc[]
Here we rename a single field and return it, along with an
input Tuple field, as the result. All other fields are
dropped.



Coerce values to specific primitive types::
include::identity-coerce.adoc[]
Here we replace the Tuple String values "status" and
"size" with [classname]+int+ and
[classname]+long+ values, respectively. All other
fields are dropped.




+
Or we can replace just the Tuple String value "status"
with an [classname]+int+, while keeping all the other
values in the output Tuple.

include::identity-coerce-single.adoc[]






[[debug-function]]
== Debug Function

The [classname]+cascading.operation.Debug+ function is a
utility function (actually, it's a [classname]++Filter++) that
prints the current argument Tuple to either [code]+stdout+ or
[code]+stderr+. Used with one of the
[classname]+DebugLevel+ enum values
([classname]++NONE++, [classname]++DEFAULT++, or
[classname]++VERBOSE++), different debug levels can be embedded
in a pipe assembly.

The example below inserts a [classname]+Debug+ operation
at the [classname]+VERBOSE+ level, but configures the planner
to remove all [classname]+Debug+ operations from the resulting
[classname]+Flow+.

Note that if the above Flow is run on a cluster, the
[code]+stdout+ on the cluster nodes will be used. Nothing from the
debug output will display on the client side. Debug is only useful when
testing things in an IDE or if the remote logs are readily
available.



== Sample and Limit Functions

The Sample and Limit functions are used to limit the number of
tuples that pass through a pipe assembly.

Sample::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.filter.Sample+ filter
allows a percentage of tuples to pass.


Limit::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.filter.Limit+ filter
allows a set number of tuples to pass.






== Insert Function

The [classname]+cascading.operation.Insert+ function
allows for insertion of constant literal values into the tuple
stream.

This is most useful when a splitting a tuple stream and one of the
branches needs some identifying value, or when some missing parameter or
value, like a date String for the current date, needs to be
inserted.



== Text Functions

Cascading includes a number of text functions in the
[classname]+cascading.operation.text+ package.

DateFormatter::
include::text-format-date.adoc[]
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.text.DateFormatter+
function is used to convert a date timestamp to a formatted
String. This function expects a [classname]+long+
value representing the number of milliseconds since January 1,
1970, 00:00:00 GMT/UTC, and formats the output using
[classname]+java.text.SimpleDateFormat+ syntax.




+
The example above converts a [classname]+long+
timestamp ("ts") to a date String.


DateParser::
include::text-create-timestamp.adoc[]
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.text.DateParser+
function is used to convert a text date String to a timestamp,
using the [classname]+java.text.SimpleDateFormat+
syntax. The timestamp is a [classname]+long+ value
representing the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970,
00:00:00 GMT/UTC. By default, the output is a field with the
name "ts" (for timestamp), but this can be overridden by passing
a declared Fields value.




+
In the example above, an Apache log-style date-time field
is converted into a [classname]+long+ timestamp in
UTC.


FieldJoiner::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.text.FieldJoiner+
function joins all the values in a Tuple with a specified
delimiter and places the result into a new field. (For the
opposite effect, see the [classname]+RegexSplitter+
function.)


FieldFormatter::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.text.FieldFormatter+
function formats Tuple values with a given String format and
stuffs the result into a new field. The
[classname]+java.util.Formatter+ class is used to
create a new formatted String.






== Regular Expression Operations

RegexSplitter::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.regex.RegexSplitter+
function splits an argument value based on a regex pattern
String. (For the opposite effect, see the FieldJoiner function.)
Internally, this function uses
[classname]+java.util.regex.Pattern.split()+, and it
behaves accordingly. By default, it splits on the TAB character
("\t"). If it is known that a determinate number of values will
emerge from this function, it can declare field names. In this
case, if the splitter encounters more split values than field
names, the remaining values are discarded. For more information,
see [code]+java.util.regex.Pattern.split( input, limit
)+.


RegexParser::
include::regex-parser.adoc[]
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.regex.RegexParser+
function is used to extract a regex-matched value from an
incoming argument value. If the regular expression is
sufficiently complex, an [classname]+int+ array may be
provided to specify which regex groups should be returned in
which field names.




+
In the example above, a line from an Apache access log is
parsed into its component parts. Note that the
[classname]+int[]+ groups array starts at 1, not 0.
Group 0 is the whole group, so if the first field is included,
it is a copy of "line" and not "ip".


RegexReplace::
include::regex-replace.adoc[]
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.regex.RegexReplace+
function is used to replace a regex-matched value with a
specified replacement value. It can operate in a "replace all"
or "replace first" mode. For more information, see the methods
[classname]+java.util.regex.Matcher.replaceAll()+ and
[classname]+java.util.regex.Matcher.replaceFirst()+.




+
In the example above, all adjoined white space characters
are replaced with a single space character.


RegexFilter::
include::regex-filter.adoc[]
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.regex.RegexFilter+
function filters a Tuple stream based on a specified regex
value. By default, tuples that match the given pattern are kept,
and tuples that do not match are filtered out. This can be
reversed by setting "removeMatch" to [code]+true+. Also, by
default, the whole Tuple is matched against the given regex
String (in tab-delimited sections). If "matchEachElement" is set
to [code]+true+, the pattern is applied to each Tuple value
individually. For more information, see the
[classname]+java.util.regex.Matcher.find()+
method.




+
The above keeps all lines in which "68." appears at the
start of the IP address.


RegexGenerator::
include::regex-generator.adoc[]
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.regex.RegexGenerator+
function emits a new tuple for every string (found in an input
tuple) that matches a specified regex pattern.




+
Above each "line" in a document is parsed into unique
words and stored in the "word" field of each result
Tuple.


RegexSplitGenerator::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.regex.RegexSplitGenerator+
function emits a new Tuple for every split on the incoming
argument value delimited by the given pattern String. The
behavior is similar to the [classname]+RegexSplitter+
function, except that (assuming multiple matches)
[classname]+RegexSplitter+ emits a single tuple that
may contain multiple values, and
[classname]+RegexSplitGenerator+ emits multiple tuples
that each contain only one value, as does
[classname]+RegexGenerator+.






[[operation-expression]]
== Java Expression Operations

Cascading provides some support for dynamically-compiled Java
expressions to be used in either [classname]+Functions+ or
[classname]+Filters+. This capability is provided by the
Janino embedded Java compiler, which compiles the expressions into byte
code for optimal processing speed. Janino is documented in detail on its
website, <<,http://www.janino.net/>>.

This capability allows an Operation to evaluate a suitable
one-line Java expression, such as [code]+$$a + 3 * 2$$+ or [code]+a &lt;
7+, where the variable values ( [code]+a+ and [code]++b++)
are passed in as Tuple fields. The result of the Operation thus depends
on the evaluated result of the expression - in the first example, some
number, and in the second, a Boolean value.

ExpressionFunction::
include::expression-function.adoc[]
The function
[classname]+cascading.operation.expression.ExpressionFunction+
dynamically composes a string expression when executed,
assigning argument Tuple values to variables in the
expression.




+
Above, we create a new String value that contains an
expression containing values from the current Tuple. Note that
you must declare the type for every input Tuple field so that
the expression compiler knows how to treat the variables in the
expression.


ExpressionFilter::
include::expression-filter.adoc[]
The filter
[classname]+cascading.operation.expression.ExpressionFilter+
evaluates a Boolean expression, assigning argument Tuple values
to variables in the expression. If the expression returns
[code]+true+, the Tuple is removed from the stream.




+
In this example, every line in the Apache log that does
not have a status of "200" is filtered out. ExpressionFilter
coerces the value into the specified type if necessary to make
the comparison - in this case, coercing the status String into
an [classname]+int+.




As of Cascading 2.2, along with
[classname]+cascading.operation.expression.ExpressionFilter+
and
[classname]+cascading.operation.expression.ExpressionFunction+,
two new operations have been added to support multi-line Java code,
[classname]+cascading.operation.expression.ScriptFilter+ and
[classname]+cascading.operation.expression.ScriptFunction+.
See the relevant Javadoc for details on usage.



== XML Operations

To use XML Operations in a Cascading application, include the
_cascading-xml-x.y.z.jar_ in the project. When using
the [classname]+TagSoupParser+ operation, this module requires
the TagSoup library, which provides support for HTML and XML "tidying".
More information is available at the TagSoup website, <<,http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/>>.

XPathParser::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.adoc.XPathParser+
function uses one or more XPath expressions, passed into the
constructor, to extract one or more node values from an XML
document contained in the passed Tuple argument, and places the
result(s) into one or more new fields in the current Tuple. In
this way, it effectively parses an XML document into a table of
fields, creating one Tuple field value for every given XPath
expression. The [classname]+Node+ is converted to a
String type containing an XML document. If only the text values
are required, search on the [code]+text()+ nodes, or
consider using XPathGenerator to handle multiple
[classname]+NodeList+ values. If the returned result
of an XPath expression is a [classname]+NodeList+,
only the first [classname]+Node+ is used for the field
value and the rest are ignored.


XPathGenerator::
Similar to XPathParser, the
[classname]+cascading.operation.adoc.XPathGenerator+
function emits a new [classname]+Tuple+ for every
[classname]+Node+ returned by the given XPath
expression from the XML in the current Tuple.


XPathFilter::
The filter
[classname]+cascading.operation.adoc.XPathFilter+
removes a Tuple if the specified XPath expression returns
[code]+false+. Set the removeMatch parameter to
[code]+true+ if the filter should be reversed, i.e., to
keep only those Tuples where the XPath expression returns
[code]+true+.


TagSoupParser::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.adoc.TagSoupParser+
function uses the TagSoup library to convert incoming HTML to
clean XHTML. Use the [code]+setFeature( feature, value )+
method to set TagSoup-specific features, which are documented on
the TagSoup website.






== Assertions

Cascading Stream Assertions are used to build robust reusable pipe
assemblies. If desired, they can be planned out of a Flow instance at
runtime. For more information, see the section on <<stream-assertions>>. Below we describe the Assertions
available in the core library.

AssertEquals::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertEquals+
Assertion asserts that the number of values given on the
constructor is equal to the number of argument Tuple values, and
that each constructor value [code]+.equals()+ its
corresponding argument value.


AssertNotEquals::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertNotEquals+
Assertion asserts that the number of values given on the
constructor is equal to the number of argument Tuple values and
that each constructor value is not [code]+.equals()+ to its
corresponding argument value.


AssertEqualsAll::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertEqualsAll+
Assertion asserts that every value in the argument Tuple
[code]+.equals()+ the single value given on the
constructor.


AssertExpression::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertExpression+
Assertion dynamically resolves a given Java expression (see
<<operation-expression>>) using argument Tuple
values. Any Tuple that returns [code]+true+ for the given
expression passes the assertion.


AssertMatches::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertMatches+
Assertion matches the given regular expression pattern String
against the entire argument Tuple. The comparison is made
possible by concatenating all the fields of the Tuple, separated
by the TAB character (\t). If a match is found, the Tuple passes
the assertion.


AssertMatchesAll::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertMatchesAll+
Assertion matches the given regular expression pattern String
against each argument Tuple value individually.


AssertNotNull::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertNotNull+
Assertion asserts that every position/field in the argument
Tuple is not [code]+null+.


AssertNull::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertNull+
Assertion asserts that every position/field in the argument
Tuple is [code]+null+.


AssertSizeEquals::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertSizeEquals+
Assertion asserts that the current Tuple in the tuple stream is
exactly the given size. Size, here, is the number of fields in
the Tuple, as returned by [code]+Tuple.size()+. Note that
some or all fields may be [code]+null+.


AssertSizeLessThan::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertSizeLessThan+
Assertion asserts that the current Tuple in the stream has a
size less than ([code]++&lt;++) the given size. Size, here,
is the number of fields in the Tuple, as returned by
[code]++Tuple.size()++. Note that some or all fields may be
[code]++null++.


AssertSizeMoreThan::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertSizeMoreThan+
Assertion asserts that the current Tuple in the stream has a
size greater than ([code]++&gt;++) the given size. Size,
here, is the number of fields in the Tuple, as returned by
[code]++Tuple.size()++. Note that some or all fields may be
[code]++null++.


AssertGroupSizeEquals::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertGroupSizeEquals+
Group Assertion asserts that the number of items in the current
grouping is equal to ([code]++==++) the given size. If a
pattern String is given, only grouping keys that match the
regular expression will have this assertion applied where
multiple key values are delimited by a TAB character.


AssertGroupSizeLessThan::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertGroupSizeEquals+
Group Assertion asserts that the number of items in the current
grouping is less than ([code]++&lt;++) the given size. If a
pattern String is given, only grouping keys that match the
regular expression will have this assertion applied where
multiple key values are delimited by a TAB character.


AssertGroupSizeMoreThan::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.assertion.AssertGroupSizeEquals+
Group Assertion asserts that the number of items in the current
grouping is greater than ([code]++&gt;++) the given size. If
a pattern String is given, only grouping keys that match the
regular expression will have this assertion applied where
multiple key values are delimited by a TAB character.






== Logical Filter Operators

The logical [classname]+Filter+ operators allow you to
combine multiple filters to run in a single Pipe, instead of chaining
multiple Pipes together to get the same logical result.

And::
The [classname]+cascading.operation.filter.And+
[classname]+Filter+ performs a logical "and" on the
results of the constructor-provided
[classname]+Filter+ instances. That is, if
[methodname]+Filter#isRemove()+ returns
[code]+true+ for all of the given instances, this filter
returns [code]+true+.


Or::
The [classname]+cascading.operation.filter.Or+
[classname]+Filter+ performs a logical "or" on the
results of the constructor-provided
[classname]+Filter+ instances. That is, if
[methodname]+Filter#isRemove()+ returns
[code]+true+ for any of the given instances, this filter
returns [code]+true+.


Not::
The [classname]+cascading.operation.filter.Not+
[classname]+Filter+ performs a logical "not"
(negation) on the results of the constructor-provided
[classname]+Filter+ instance. That is, if
[methodname]+Filter#isRemove()+ returns
[code]+true+ for the given instance, this filter returns
[code]+false+, and if
[methodname]+Filter#isRemove()+ returns
[code]+false+ for the given instance, this filter returns
[code]+true+.


Xor::
The [classname]+cascading.operation.filter.Xor+
[classname]+Filter+ performs a logical "xor"
(exclusive or) on the results of the constructor-provided
[classname]+Filter+ instances. Xor can only be applied
to two instances at a time. It returns [code]+true+ if the
two instances have different truth values, and
[code]+false+ if they have the same truth value. That is,
if [methodname]+Filter.isRemove()+ returns
[code]+true+ for both, or returns [code]+false+ for
both, this filter returns [code]++false++; otherwise it
returns [code]+true+.




.Combining Filters
====
include::filter-and.adoc[]
====

The example above performs a logical "and" on the two filters.
Both must be satisfied for the data to pass through this one
Pipe.



== Buffers

As of Cascading 2.2, the FirstNBuffer Buffer is provided as an
optimized means to determine the top N elements in a grouping.

FirstNBuffer::
The
[classname]+cascading.operation.buffer.FirstNBuffer+
[classname]+Buffer+ returns the first N tuples seen in
a given grouping. Unlike the
[classname]+cascading.pipe.assembly.FirstBy+
[classname]+AggregateBy+ and
[classname]+cascading.operation.aggregator.First+
[classname]+Aggregator+,
[classname]+FirstNBuffer+ will stop iterating the
available tuples when the top N condition is met.
[classname]+FirstNBuffer+ is used by
[classname]+cascading.pipe.assembly.Unique+.
