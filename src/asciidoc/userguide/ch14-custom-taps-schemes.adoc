:doctitle: {_doctitle} - Custom Taps and Schemes

== Custom Taps and Schemes

=== Introduction

Cascading is designed to be easily configured and enhanced by developers. In
addition to creating custom Operations, developers can create custom
[classname]+Tap+ and [classname]+Scheme+ classes that let applications connect
to external systems or read/write data to proprietary formats.

A Tap represents something physical, like a file or a database table.
Accordingly, Tap implementations are responsible for life-cycle issues around
the resource they represent, such as tests for resource existence, or to perform
resource deletion (dropping a remote SQL table).

A Scheme represents a format or representation - such as a text format for a
file, the columns in a table, etc. Schemes are used to convert between the
source data's native format and a [classname]+cascading.tuple.Tuple+ instance.

Creating custom taps and schemes can be an involved process and will require
knowledge of the underlying platform. Not only do Tap and Scheme classes
manage the access to a resource or the format of the resource, they must also
abstract away details of the underlying platform.

For examples of how to implement a custom tap and scheme for different
platforms, see the http://.cascading.org/extensions/[Cascading Extensions] page
for source code of similiar extensions.

=== Custom Taps

All custom Tap classes must subclass the [classname]+cascading.tap.Tap+ abstract
class and implement the required methods. The method
[methodname]+getIdentifier()+ must return a [classname]+String+ that uniquely
identifies the resource the Tap instance is managing. Any two Tap instances with
the same fully-qualified identifier value will be considered equal.

Every Tap is presented an opportunity to set any custom properties the
underlying platform requires, via the methods [methodname]+sourceConfInit()+
(for when it is used as a _source tap_) and [methodname]+sinkConfInit()+ (for
when it is used as a _sink tap_). These two methods may be called more than once
with new configuration objects, and should be idempotent.

Tuples are always read (sourced) from the [methodname]+openForRead()+
method via a [classname]+TupleEntryIterator+ - i.e., [methodname]+openForRead()+
is always called in the same process that will read the data. It is up to the
Tap to return a [classname]+TupleEntryIterator+ that will iterate across the
resource, returning a [classname]+TupleEntry+ instance (and [classname]+Tuple+
instance) for each "record" in the resource.
[methodname]+TupleEntryIterator.close()+ is always called when no more entries
will be read.

For more on this topic, see [classname]+TupleEntrySchemeIterator+ in the
Javadoc.

On some platforms, [methodname]+openForRead()+ is called with a pre-instantiated
Input type. Typically this Input type should be used instead of instantiating a
new instance of the appropriate type.

Similarly, when writing (sinking) Tuple data, a Tap is always used to sink data
from the [methodname]+openForWrite()+ method via the
[classname]+TupleEntryCollector+. Here again, [methodname]+openForWrite()+ is
always called in the process in which data will be written. It is up to the Tap
to return a [classname]+TupleEntryCollector+ that will accept and store any
number of [classname]+TupleEntry+ or [classname]+Tuple+ instances for each
record that is processed or created by a given Flow.
[methodname]+TupleEntryCollector.close()+ is always called when no more entries
will be written.

See [classname]+TupleEntrySchemeCollector+ in the Javadoc.

Again, on some platforms, [methodname]+openForWrite()+ will be called with a
pre-instantiated Output type. Typically this Output type should be used instead
of instantiating a new instance of the appropriate type.

Both the [classname]+TupleEntrySchemeIterator+ and
[classname]+TupleEntrySchemeCollector+ should be used to hold any state or
resources necessary to communicate with any remote services. For example, when
connecting to a SQL database, any JDBC drivers should be created on the
constructor and cleaned up on [methodname]+close()+.

Note that the Tap is not responsible for reading or writing data to the Input or
Output type. This is delegated to the [classname]+Scheme+ passed on the
constructor of the [classname]+Tap+. Consequently, the [classname]+Scheme+ is
responsible for configuring the Input and Output types it will be reading and
writing.

=== Custom Schemes

All custom Scheme classes must subclass the [classname]+cascading.scheme.Scheme+
abstract class and implement the required methods.

A [classname]+Scheme+ is ultimately responsible for sourcing and sinking Tuples
of data. Consequently it must know what [classname]+Fields+ it presents during
sourcing, and what [classname]+Fields+ it accepts during sinking. Thus the
constructors on the base [classname]+Scheme+ type must be set with the source
and sink Fields.

A Scheme is allowed to source different Fields than it sinks. The
[classname]+TextLine+ [classname]+Scheme+ does just this. (The
[classname]+TextDelimited+ [classname]+Scheme+, on the other hand, forces the
source and sink [classname]+Fields+ to be the same.)

The [methodname]+retrieveSourceFields()+ and [methodname]+retrieveSinkFields()+
methods allow a custom [classname]+Scheme+ to fetch its source and sink
[classname]+Fields+ immediately before the planner is invoked - for example,
from the header of a file, as is the case with [classname]+TextDelimited+. Also
the [methodname]+presentSourceFields()+ and [methodname]+presentSinkFields()+
methods notify the [classname]+Scheme+ of the [classname]+Fields+ that the
planner expects the Scheme to handle - for example, to write the field names as
a header, as is the case with [classname]+TextDelimited+.

Every [classname]+Scheme+ is presented the opportunity to set any custom
properties the underlying platform requires, via the methods
[methodname]+sourceConfInit()+ and [methodname]+sinkConfInit()+. These methods
may be called more than once with new configuration objects, and should be
idempotent.

A Scheme is always sourced via the [methodname]+source()+ method, and is always
sunk to via the [methodname]+sink()+ method.

Prior to the first [methodname]+source()+ or [methodname]+sink()+ call, the
[methodname]+sourcePrepare()+ and [methodname]+sinkPrepare()+ methods are
called. After all values have been read or written, the
[methodname]+ourceCleanup()+ and [methodname]+sinkCleanup()+ methods are called.

The [methodname]+*Prepare()+ methods allow a Scheme to initialize any state
necessary - for example, to create a new [classname]+java.util.regex.Matcher+
instance for use against all record reads). Conversely, the
[methodname]+*Cleanup()+ methods allow for clearing up any resources.

These methods are always called in the same process space as their associated
[methodname]+source()+ and [methodname]+sink()+ calls. In the case of a
clustered platform platform, this will likely be on the cluster side, unlike
calls to [methodname]+*ConfInit()+ which will likely be on the client side (but
not guaranteed).

=== SinkModes

=== File Like Taps

Tap classes that are meant to manage resources that are files should implement
the interface [classname]+cascading.tap.type.FileType+.

This interfaces allows a Tap to be used directly by a user to manipulate the
remote filesystem, or retrieve child resources (files in sub-directories).

Non-file like resources should not be managed by a Tap that implements this
interface. For example, a "JDBCTap" implementation would not treat tables as
directories with child files.

=== Tap Lifecycle Methods

The Tap interface has a number of _lifecycle_ methods that allow the underlying
resource to be managed by the Tap instance.

Existence::

These methods test for existence or create the resource managed by the Tap.

+

* [methodname]+resourceExists()+ - called frequently, should be idempotent
* [methodname]+deleteResource()+ - only called if [code]+SinkMode+ is
  [classname]+SinkMode.REPLACE+, or from within a Cascading and the resource is
  _stale_.

Initialization::

These methods allow for client side initialization of a remote resource that
will be shared across parallelized instances cluster side. For example, creating
a database table if it does not exist so that data may be written to it from the
cluster. Note this is not the same as initializing a JDBC Driver client side and
sharing it with the cluster, Driver initialization must happen with
[methodname]+openForWrite()+ or [methodname]+openForRead()+.

+

* [methodname]+prepareResourceForRead()+ - initialize any shared remote resource
  for reading
* [methodname]+prepareResourceForWrite()+ - initialize any shared remote
  resource for writing

Reading and Writing::

These methods may be called client or cluster side, and either by Cascading in
the course of execution, or by a developer wishing direct access to the
underlying data managed by the Tap instance. No data can be read or written
without one of these methods being called.

+

These methods are described in more detail above.

+

* [methodname]+openForRead()+
* [methodname]+openForWrite()+

Transactional::

These methods notify a given Tap instance if the parent Flow was successful or
if there was a failure. They are called client side so that any remote shared
resources can be cleaned up or any changes written can be committed/persisted.
They are only invoked if the Tap instance is used as a sink.

+

* [methodname]+commitResource()+ - commit the saved values written to the resource
* [methodname]+rollbackResource()+ - revert the resource to its original state
