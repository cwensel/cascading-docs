== Anatomy of a Word Count Application

The most common example presented to new developers is an application that
counts words. It is the data processing equivalent to a "Hello World"
application.

In a word-counting application, a document is parsed into individual words and
the frequency (count) of each word is calculated. In the last paragraph, for
example, "is" appears twice and "equivalent" appears once.

The following code example uses the Cascading default API to read each line of
text from our document file, parse it into words, then count the number of times
each word appears.

.Word Counting
====
include::basic-word-count.adoc[]

<1> Read each line of text from a file and give it the field name "line"

<2> Parse each "line" into words with the [code]+RegexGenerator+ object, which
returns each word in the field named "word"

<3> Sort and group all the tuples on the "word" field, using the [code]+GroupBy+
object

<4> Count the number of elements in each group, using the [code]+Count+ object,
and store this value in the "count" field

<5> Write out the "word" and "count" fields

<6> Set application specific meta-data to allow the application to run

<7> Choose the platform to execute on

<8> Plan the unit of work to be executed, a Flow

<9> Start the Flow and wait till completed

Several features of this example are worth highlighting.

First, notice that the pipe assembly is not coupled to the data (i.e., the
[classname]+Tap+ instances) until the last moment before execution. File paths
or references are not embedded in the pipe assembly; instead, the pipe assembly
is specified independent of data inputs and outputs. The only dependency is the
data scheme, i.e., the field names.

In Cascading, every input or output file has field names associated with its
contents, and every processing element of the pipe assembly either expects the
specified fields from upstream or creates them. This allows developers to easily
self-document their code, and allows the Cascading planner to "fail fast" if an
expected dependency between elements isn't satisfied - for instance, if a needed
field name is missing or incorrect.

Also notice that pipe assemblies are assembled through constructor chaining.
This may seem odd, but it is done for two reasons.

First, it allows each object to be immutable.

Second, it prevents developers from creating "cycles" (i.e., recursive loops) in
the resulting pipe assembly. Pipe assemblies are intended to be Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAG's), and in keeping with this, the Cascading planner is not designed
to handle processes that feed themselves. (If desired, there are safer
approaches to achieving this result.)

Finally, notice that the very first [code]+Pipe+ instance has a name. That
instance is the _head_ of this particular pipe assembly. Pipe assemblies can
have any number of heads, and any number of _tails_.

Although the tail in this example does not have an explicit name, in a more
complex assembly it would (since this assembly is a single branch, the tail
inherits the head name).

In general, heads and tails of pipe assemblies are assigned names to
disambiguate them. One reason is that names are used to bind sources and sinks
to pipes during planning. (The example above is an exception, because there is
only one head and one tail - and consequently only one source and one sink - so
the binding is unmistakable.) Another reason is that the naming of pipes
contributes to self-documentation of pipe assemblies, especially where there are
splits, joins, and merges in the assembly.

== An Alternative Fluent API

The above example is using the default "raw" Cascading API. This API is handy
when creating very complex business logic, or creating frameworks that may need
to algorithmically generate Cascading assemblies.
[Lingual](http://www.cascading.org/lingual/), an ANSI SQL layer over Cascading,
leverages this API.

An alternative API is called [Fluid](http://www.cascading.org/fluid/).

Currently Fluid is maintained in a different project, but there are plans to
make it available as part of all future Cascading releases. As well as provide
a build plugin to allow any custom code to have fluent APIs generated as part
of the build process.

Here is the word count example from above re-written with the Fluid fluent API
(and with all comments removed).

.Word Counting with Fluid
====
include::basic-word-count-fluid.adoc[]
<1> Read each line of text from a file and give it the field name "line"
<2> Parse each "line" into words with the [code]+RegexGenerator+ object, which
returns each word in the field named "word"
<3> Sort and group all the tuples on the "word" field, using the [code]+GroupBy+
object
<4> Count the number of elements in each group, using the [code]+Count+ object,
and store this value in the "count" field
<5> Write out the "word" and "count" fields
<6> Set application specific meta-data to allow the application to run
<7> Choose the platform to execute on
<8> Plan the unit of work to be executed, a Flow
<9> Start the Flow and wait till completed

The remainder of this User Guide will focus on the default Cascading Java API
introduced in the first example above.
