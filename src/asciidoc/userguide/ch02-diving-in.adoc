= Diving In

The most common example presented to new Hadoop (and MapReduce)
developers is an application that counts words. It is the Hadoop
equivalent to a "Hello World" application.

In the word-counting application, a document is parsed into
individual words and the frequency of each word is counted. In the last
paragraph, for example, "is" appears twice and "equivalent" appears
once.

The following code example uses Cascading to read each line of text
from our document file, parse it into words, then count the number of
times each word appears.

Several features of this example are worth highlighting.

First, notice that the pipe assembly is not coupled to the data
(i.e., the [classname]+Tap+ instances) until the last moment
before execution. File paths or references are not embedded in the pipe
assembly; instead, the pipe assembly is specified independent of data
inputs and outputs. The only dependency is the data scheme, i.e., the
field names. In Cascading, every input or output file has field names
associated with it, and every processing element of the pipe assembly
either expects the specified fields or creates them. This allows
developers to easily self-document their code, and allows the Cascading
planner to "fail fast" if an expected dependency between elements isn't
satisfied - for instance, if a needed field name is missing or incorrect.
(If more information is desired on the planner, see <<job-planner>>.)

Also notice that pipe assemblies are assembled through constructor
chaining. This may seem odd, but it is done for two reasons. First, it
keeps the code more concise. Second, it prevents developers from creating
"cycles" (i.e., recursive loops) in the resulting pipe assembly. Pipe
assemblies are intended to be Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG's), and in
keeping with this, the Cascading planner is not designed to handle
processes that feed themselves. (If desired, there are safer approaches to
achieving this result.

Finally, notice that the very first [code]+Pipe+ instance has a
name. That instance is the _head_ of this
particular pipe assembly. Pipe assemblies can have any number of heads,
and any number of _tails_. Although the
tail in this example does not have a name, in a more complex assembly it
would. In general, heads and tails of pipe assemblies are assigned names
to disambiguate them. One reason is that names are used to bind sources
and sinks to pipes during planning. (The example above is an exception,
because there is only one head and one tail - and consequently only one
source and one sink - so the binding is unmistakable.) Another reason is
that the naming of pipes contributes to self-documentation of pipe
assemblies, especially where there are splits, joins, and merges in the
assembly.

To sum up, the example word-counting application will:

*
Read each line of text from a file and give it the field name
"line"



*
parse each "line" into words with the
[code]+RegexGenerator+ object, which returns each word in the
field named "word"



*
sort and group all the tuples on the "word" field, using the
[code]+GroupBy+ object



*
count the number of elements in each group, using the
[code]+Count+ object, and store this value in the "count"
field



* and write out the "word" and "count" fields.
