A Cascade allows multiple Flow instances to be executed as a single logical
unit. If there are dependencies between the Flows, they are executed in the
correct order.

Further, Cascade instances act like a compiler build file - that is, a Cascade
only executes Flows that have stale sinks (i.e., output data that is older than
the input data). For more on this, see <<ch06-flows.adoc#skipping-flows>>.

When passing Flows to the CascadeConnector, order is not important. The
CascadeConnector automatically identifies the dependencies between the given
Flows and creates a scheduler that starts each Flow as its data sources become
available. If two or more Flow instances have no interdependencies, they are
submitted together so that they can execute in parallel.

If an instance of
[classname]+cascading.flow.FlowSkipStrategy+ is given to a
[classname]+Cascade+ instance (via the
[classname]+Cascade.setFlowSkipStrategy()+ method), it is
consulted for every Flow instance managed by that Cascade, and all skip
strategies on those Flow instances are ignored.

== The Cascade Topological Scheduler

Cascading has a simple class, [classname]+Cascade+, that executes a collection
of Cascading Flows on a target cluster in dependency order.

Consider the following example.

* Flow 1 reads input file A and outputs B.
* Flow 2 expects input B and outputs C and D.
* Flow 3 expects input C and outputs E.


A [classname]+Cascade+ is constructed through the [classname]+CascadeConnector+
class, by building an internal graph that makes each Flow a "vertex", and each
file an "edge". A topological walk on this graph will touch each vertex in order
of its dependencies. When a vertex has all its incoming edges (i.e., files)
available, it is scheduled on the cluster.

In the example above, Flow 1 goes first, Flow 2 goes second, and Flow 3 is last.

If two or more Flows are independent of one another, they are scheduled
concurrently.

And by default, if any outputs from a Flow are newer than the inputs, the Flow
is skipped. The assumption is that the Flow was executed recently, since the
output isn't stale. So there is no reason to re-execute it and use up resources
or add time to the application. This is similar behavior a compiler would
exhibit if a source file wasn't updated before a recompile.

This is very handy if you have a large set of jobs, with varying
interdependencies between them, that needs to be executed as a logical unit.
Just pass them to the CascadeConnector and let it sort them all out.
