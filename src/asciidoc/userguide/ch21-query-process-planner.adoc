== The Cascading Process Planner

For an introduction to the thinking and design behind the 3.0 query planner, see
the blog post
http://cascading.org/2014/09/18/the-cascading-3-0-query-planner/[The Cascading
3.0 Query Planner] on http://cascading.org/.

=== FlowConnector

The various [classname]+FlowConnector+s provided by Cascading are covered in the
section <<ch03-basic-concepts.adoc#platforms,Platforms>>.

Common to all sub-classes is the ability to provide a custom
[classname]+RuleRegistrySet+ which in turn encapsulates one or more
[classname]+RuleRegistry+ instances, which in turn provide a set of
[classname]+Rule+ instances.

The [classname]+RuleRegistrySet+ is mutable, thus the default registry can be
retrieved via [methodname]+FlowConnector.getRuleRegistrySet()+ and updated.

=== RuleRegistrySet

The [classname]+RuleRegistrySet+ manages one or more [classname]+RuleRegistry+
instances.

During planning, all registered RuleRegistries will be used independently to
create candidate execution plans. If more than one RuleRegistry is available
they all will be executed in parallel, though a total plan timeout can be
provided in the case a planner executes too long.

When the planner completes, either the first or 'best' plan will be utilized,
depending on the value of [methodname]+RuleRegistrySet.setSelect()+, which can
be one of two values:

[classname]+Select.FIRST+::

The first [classname]+RuleRegistry+ instance to complete will be used. All
remaining planners will be cancelled.

[classname]+Select.COMPARED+::

The _best_ [classname]+RuleRegistry+ instance will be used where best is a
function of the registred [code]+planComparator+, set by calling
[methodname]+RuleRegistrySet.setPlanComparator()+.

+

If not set, the default behavior will be to choose the plan with the fewest
[classname]+FlowStep+ instances, and if equal, the fewest [classname]+FlowNode+
instances. Otherwise the order in which the [classname]+RuleRegistry+ instances
were registered will prevail.

NOTE: Relying the fewest [classname]+FlowStep+ and [classname]+FlowNode+
instances in the resulting plan is a simplified version of _cost_. If competing
plans can  be measured differently, supply a custom [classname]+Comparator+ to
perform the comparison.

Support for multiple registries in important. As Cascading advances, new
primitives, at the [classname]+Pipe+ level, will added that offer new
optimizations or  capabilities.

These additions have consequences when related to the set of other pipe
primitives being utilized. Each new primitive will add to the time complexity of
finding a suitable plan, and frequently two or more primitives working together
add yet another  topological complexity (some combinations could cause failures
if not accounted for).

The end result is that a one-size-fits-all rule set, in order to be safe, makes
conservative decisions so that plan time or the resulting execution are
reasonable instead of optimal.

By allowing multiple simultaneous plans, the rule set can decide if it is
applicable, and if so, will apply itself. If not applicable, it will leave the
competition.

The Cascading Apache Tez planner provides a rule registry that supports
[classname]+HashJoin+ pipes, and one that does not.

Under very complex scenarios, when HashJoins are in play, the planner can
execute must faster if it makes some compromises to limit the search space the
planner must navigate to find a functional plan. When there are no HashJoins, it
isn't worth the time to find and apply the compromises.

=== RuleRegistry

The [classname]+RuleRegistry+ contains a set of [classname]+Rule+s. Rules in
short navigate and mutate what is known as an *Element Graph*, simply a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) of [classname]+Pipe+ and [classname]+Tap+ instances
connected by edges ([classname]+Scope+ instances).

The input of a rule is an element graph, and the output is either a
[classname]+PlannerException+ a modified element graph, or a sub-graph of the
given element graph.

Of which, there are three main types:

[classname]+RuleAssert+::

This rule simply provides an _assertion_ mechanism about the structure of the
pipe assembly. If a pipe or tap is in the wrong place or unsupported, it can
throw what amounts to a syntax error, which includes the name and location of
the offending element.

[classname]+RuleTransformer+::

This rule provides a means to modify or mutate a given element graph. Either the
element graph can have elements removed or added.

+

In addition to mutating an element graph, a transformer can _annotate_ the graph
with meta-data that can inform downstream rules, or Cascading itself during
runtime.  Identifying the _accumulated_ and _streamed_ sides of a HashJoin
greatly simplifies the construction of the actual execution logic.

[classname]+RulePartitioner+::

This rule provides a means to break a large graph into smaller graphs. This is
where a pipe assembly along with attached sources and sinks are broken down into
[classname]+FlowStep+, [classname]+FlowNode+ and possibly
[classname]+FlowPipeline+ instances.

+

It should be noted that a partitioner can partition the current top level
element graph, or re-partition a prior sub-graph element graph into new
sub-graphs.

+

See the section on <<ch06-flows.adoc#process-levels,Flow Process Hierarchy>>
for details on the roles these classes play.

In addition to the Rules, rules are applies at different phases. There are
twelve [classname]+PlanPhase+ types:

[classname]+PreBalanceAssembly+::

The PreBalanceAssembly phase is where most assertions are applied.

[classname]+BalanceAssembly+::

The BalanceAssembly phase is where, for example with MapReduce, intermediate
taps are injected into the element graph.

[classname]+PostBalanceAssembly+::

The PostBalanceAssembly phase provides a means to perform any cleanup after the
balancing phase.

[classname]+PreResolveAssembly+::

The PreResolveAssembly phase is where any _no op_ pipe instances, or unnecessary
[classname]+Debug+ or [classname]+Assertion+ filters should be removed
(depending on the configured [classname]+DebugLevel+ or
[classname]+AssertionLevel+, respectively.)

[classname]+ResolveAssembly+::

The ResolveAssembly is where Cascading performs all field resolution by
inspecting the source and sink taps and any operations that produce or require
fields, to ensure that all field level dependencies are satisfied.

+

No rules are applied in this phase.

[classname]+PostResolveAssembly+::

The PostResolveAssembly phase is where any logical optimizations could be
applied based on now fully resolved field names in the element graph prior to
any sub-graph partitioning.

[classname]+PartitionSteps+::

The PartitionSteps phase is where the element graphs that represent the work
that would be contained in individual [classname]+FlowStep+ instances are found.

+

In the case of MapReduce, all the MapReduce jobs would be broken out into
individual sub-graph element graphs, each bounded by source and sink taps, or
intermediate temporary source and sink taps.

[classname]+PostSteps+::

The PostSteps phase provides a means to clean up post step partitioning.

[classname]+PartitionNodes+::

The PartitionNodes phase is where the element graphs that represent the work
that would be contained in individual [classname]+FlowNode+ instances are found.

[classname]+PostNodes+::

The PostNodes phase provides a means to clean up post node partitioning.
Frequently malformed remainder sub-graphs may result in rules that have already
been applied, this is the best opportunity to remove these graphs.

[classname]+PartitionPipelines+::

The PartitionPipelines phase is where the element graphs that represent the work
that would be contained in individual [classname]+FlowPipeline+ instances are
found.

+

In the case of MapReduce, a _mapper function_ can have multiple discrete input
paths that correspond to different computation paths. Consider joining two
files, one pipeline would process the left hand side, and another the right hand
side. The side to process within the [classname]+FlowNode+ is determined at
runtime when the child mapper JVM is instantiated and handed an _input split_, a
portion of one of the input files, that in turn corresponds to one of the
pipelines.

[classname]+PostPipelines+::

The PostPipelines phase provides a means to clean up post pipeline partitioning.
Frequently malformed remainder sub-graphs may result in rules that have already
been applied, this is the best opportunity to remove these graphs.

=== Debugging RuleRegistrySets

Debugging planner rules can be done by enabling the various trace mechanisms
outlined  in the section on
<<ch18-best-practices.adoc#debugging-planner,Debugging Planner Failures>>.
